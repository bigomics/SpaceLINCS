Description: 'SpaceLINCS' calculates and visualises correlation between
    experimental gene expression profiles with pertubation signatures from
    the LINCS L1000 project that has collected gene expression profiles
    for thousands of perturbagens at a variety of time points, doses, and
    cell lines.
